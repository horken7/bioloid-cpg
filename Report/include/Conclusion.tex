\section{Conclusion}
In the end, the simulations did not generate the desired movement patterns, even if they moved the robot forward. Despite this, it is the opinion of the authors that the chosen methods are valid and can potentially result in faster and more ''natural'' walking cycles than what a randomly seeded simulation would. However, greater care needs to be taken when considering the simulation environment, runtime, parameters for both the CPG and the GA, and the fitness function. The authors encourage anyone interested to continue building on this project, as it is a great learning experience regardless of the generated results. The code base and this report should serve as a sufficient base for anyone considering to continue this work.
