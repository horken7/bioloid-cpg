\section*{Abstract}
A walking cycle for a humanoid robot can be generated through means of reinforced learning algorithms, such as a genetic algorithm. Using data captured from human movements could potentially lead to a faster convergence of the algortihm along with more stable results. A simulation was set up consisting of a CPG network connected to a genetic algorithm, along with a 3D simulation of a humanoid robot. Accelerometer data from a human walking cycle was inserted as a starting point for the algorithm in order to see if the speed and accuracy of the simulation was improved. The results from the simulation was connected to a physical humanoid robot to evaluate the generated movement pattern. Although the results were found to be unstable, the method does show potential for improvement and refinement.
