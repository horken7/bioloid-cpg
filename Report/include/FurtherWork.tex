\section{Further Work}
In order to most efficiently improve on the project, CPG model and the fitness function should be the main priority. For instance, incorporating a oscillating tonic input in the CPG model, and a greater focus on punishing unwanted behaviour via the fitness function. The V-REP model should be modified to more accurately reflect the Bioloid robot, as should the interaction between the Bioloid model and the simulation floor. Beyond this, increasing the modularity of the codebase would greatly improve the flexibilty of the project and allow for greater changes to the base of the project. In its current iteration, the GA, V-REP, parameters such as number of used servos, the fitness function, and function used to replay and evaluate generated individuals are all heavily intertwined and in some cases hardcoded. As a result, it is not possible to evaluate other reinforcement algorithms, other simulation enviroments, etc. Evaluation and fine-tuning of the GA and CPG parameters would also be of great importance, as would a more accurate simulation envionment.
